# The_knights_tour_problem_solver
This project provides a Warnsdorff's algorithm solution to the classic "Knight's Tour" problem, where the goal is to move a knight to every square on a chessboard exactly once without repeating any square.  
The program supports both standard and visualization modes, allowing users to observe the search process step by step. The increasing numbers in the output indicate the order in which the knight visits each square.

## Install 
The source code requires a compiler with c++17 support. Please ensure you have GCC 7.1 or newer installed before building.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MagicNotmac0820/The_knights_tour_problem_solver.git
```

## Usage
- If you just want to build it and then execute it, you need to
    ```
    $ make
    $ ./bin/knight_s_tour
    ```

- To build it and run it, you need to
    ```
    $ make run
    ```

- If you want to visualize the searching process, you need to
    ```
    $ make visualize
    ```

## Demo
A demonstration video will be added soon.
